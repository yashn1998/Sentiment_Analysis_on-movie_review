# Sentiment_Analysis_on_movie_review

The review sentiment analysis project focuses on developing an effective model for classifying movie reviews into sentiment categories. By accurately determining whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral, the model provides valuable insights into audience opinions. The project's outcomes have practical applications in the film industry, supporting decision-making processes, and helping stakeholders better understand public sentiment towards movies.
